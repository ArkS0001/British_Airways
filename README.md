British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.


British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - February 2024

 * Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component
   of British Airways success
 * Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
 * Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying
   behaviour


“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in British Airway's job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to
participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built predictive
model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practiced my data
analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoing and
communication skills by presenting insights a real-world context.
Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working with data to provide
business insights and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data Science team
at a company like British Airways.
